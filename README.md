AI generates personalized message templates based on campaign goals and target audience.

### 3. Performance Insights
AI analyzes campaign performance and provides actionable insights to improve future campaigns.

### 4. Customer Behavior Analysis
AI identifies patterns and trends in customer behavior to inform segmentation strategies.

### 5. Content Optimization
AI provides recommendations for optimizing campaign content based on historical performance data.

### 6. Predictive Analytics
AI forecasts campaign performance and customer engagement metrics to guide marketing strategy.
